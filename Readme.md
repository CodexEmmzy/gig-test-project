# Gig Hub Smart Contract

This is a smart contract written in Rust for managing contracts and users in a gig platform.

## Overview

The smart contract consists of several account structs and associated instructions to interact with them.

### Account Structs

1. **UserProfile**
   - Represents the profile of a user.
   - Fields:
     - `authority`: Public key of the user's authority.
     - `last_contract`: Index of the last contract created by the user.
     - `contract_count`: Total number of contracts associated with the user.

2. **ContractAccount**
   - Represents a contract in the platform.
   - Fields:
     - `idx`: Index of the contract.
     - `authority`: Public key of the contract's authority.
     - `toAssign`: Public key of the assigned party.
     - `title`: Title of the contract.
     - `description`: Description of the contract.
     - `price`: Price of the contract.
     - `assigned_master`: Index of the assigned master.
     - `created_freelancer`: Optional signer account of the freelancer who created the contract.
     - `confermed_assign`: Optional signer account of the assigned party.
     - `assigned_admin`: Optional signer account of the contract's administrator.
     - `status`: Current status of the contract.
     - `creation_date`: Timestamp of the contract creation.
     - `end_date`: Timestamp of the contract's end date.

3. **Master**
   - Represents the master contract.
   - Fields:
     - `master_contract_count`: Total count of master contracts.

### Instructions

1. **CreateMaster**
   - Creates a new master contract.
   - Inputs:
     - `master`: Account representing the master contract.
     - `payer`: Signer account responsible for paying for the transaction.
     - `system_program`: System program account for system interactions.

2. **InitUser**
   - Initializes a new user profile.
   - Inputs:
     - `authority`: Signer account representing the user's authority.
     - `user_profile`: Account representing the user's profile.
     - `system_program`: System program account for system interactions.

3. **CreateContract**
   - Creates a new contract.
   - Inputs:
     - `user_profile`: Account representing the user's profile.
     - `master`: Account representing the master contract.
     - `contract_account`: Account representing the contract.
     - `authority`: Signer account representing the contract's authority.
     - `system_program`: System program account for system interactions.

4. **TakeContract**
   - Marks a contract as taken by a party.
   - Inputs:
     - `contract_account`: Account representing the contract.
     - `authority`: Signer account representing the contract's authority.
     - `assigned_admin`: Account representing the assigned administrator.
     - `system_program`: System program account for system interactions.

5. **DoPayment**
   - Processes payment for a contract.
   - Inputs:
     - `contract_account`: Account representing the contract.
     - `authority`: Signer account representing the contract's authority.
     - `freelancer`: Account representing the freelancer.
     - `confermed_assign`: Account representing the assigned party.
     - `assigned_admin`: Account representing the assigned administrator.
     - `system_program`: System program account for system interactions.

6. **TransferTokens**
   - Transfers tokens as part of a contract transaction.
   - Inputs:
     - `contract_account`: Account representing the contract.
     - `contract_account_minted`: Account representing the minted contract tokens.
     - `from`: Signer account representing the token sender.
     - `from_ata`: Account representing the sender's token account.
     - `token_program`: Token program account for token interactions.
     - `mint_account_adress`: Account representing the minted tokens.
     - `system_program`: System program account for system interactions.

## Error Handling

The contract defines a custom error enum `GigHubError` to handle various error cases. These include:
- `InvalidInput`: Invalid input parameters.
- `TransferFailed`: Transfer of tokens failed.
- `InsufficientFunds`: Insufficient funds for payment.
- `Unauthorized`: Unauthorized access.

## How to Use

To interact with this smart contract, you can use the provided instructions with appropriate input parameters. Make sure to handle errors properly to ensure robustness and security.
